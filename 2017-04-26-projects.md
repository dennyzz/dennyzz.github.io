description: More Projects on the way

Now that we have fully transferred asset hosting to AWS S3 storage, we can move on to renovating the site and I can focus on putting more of my photography and project work into the projects section.
Hopefully those will be coming up soon, or at least bits of them, 
I'm thinking of having a photo gallery at the front with a title, so it may take some tweaking with how things are laid out in the project gallery.
