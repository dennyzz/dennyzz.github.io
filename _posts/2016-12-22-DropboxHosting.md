This website is currently hosted out of both Github pages with its .github.io address, and most of my photos are uploaded and served out of my Dropbox account. Unfortunately I have recently received the email from Dropbox notifying me that the public folder will no longer work after March 2017. See link [here](https://www.dropbox.com/help/16). It is completely understandeable since Public sharing was a very early feature of Dropbox, which is probably currently taking up too much of their bandwidth. It reduces the robustness of their sharing, but is probably more in line with the usage that they envisioned. Public sharing is definitely a hacky way to produce a single and relatively effective file sharing strategy. It was easy to use, simple to link to. I guess their problem was that it was too easy to use, and host on time. 

Regardless of how they had decided to change up their offering, I have also proactively moved forward by setting up a hosting on AWS. I realized with the traffic that this site gets ( near zero ) the cost of the AWS hosting will probably be less than a dollar a month, which is definitely manageable. We shall keep serving the images on the site up until dropbox actually does shut down the public folder, but that will work just fine.
