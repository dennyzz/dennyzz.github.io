Hello World!
This is be the beginnings of a personal portfolio. After going through all the options for a website and webhosting, who can beat free! This also gets to be a project for me to learn how to use Jekyll and to create a small online presence that I would be able to put on business cards and the like. I am planning on going back and documenting some of the projects that I have worked on over the years as well as a few albums of my photography. We'll see how this goes.
