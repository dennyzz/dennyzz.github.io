# Work In Progress
Follow along as this build progresses

## Project Goal
Design a fully functional and customizable electric longboard. Using BMS and systems design knowledge gained from SolarCar work, create a custom pack and charging solution, as well as a custom remote control and UI. 

### Design Goals
[//]: # (Maybe put down almost a to-do list of goals to meet and keep up as this progresses)
 * x Build out a test battery pack (no BMS)
 * Build out a VESC motor controller 
 * Build Drivetrain: Motor, Mounts, Pulleys, Wiring
 * Preliminary tests with VESC + Nyko Kama
 * CAD modeling the final battery pack design
 * Internal Charger and BMS design
 * External "Fast Charger" design
 * Build the Battery Electronics

### Design Ideas/Process
To get started with this build, it is best to start simple and plan for increasing features as progress is made. In this way, a minimum viable product beginning should be done. This brings us to our core components
 * Deck + Trucks + Wheels
 * Motor + Motor Mounting + Gearing
 * Motor Controller
 * Power Source
Even the longboard could be borrowed for now to start with testing, so that there is always some hardware that is actually working. 



Some fun future ideas are to port over our BMS architecture from UMSolarCar to create a 10 or 12 cell battery pack with monitoring. 
 
## Github Repository 
[//]: # (The repository will probably contain the custom stmf4 BMS firmware as well as PCB design and BOM lists)
Not yet setup, still working on initial HW design

## Other Sources
[//]: # (To link to sources for outside HW designs, other github repos, purchased parts can be put in the BOM )
