Project Pathfinder was completed for EECS 452 class (Digital Signal Processing)

Much of the material here will be pulled from the various reports done in class.

**Project Goal:** Design a system that can accomplish some features of autonomous driving. The main features explored are lane tracking and following, as well as a simple collision detection and avoidance feature. The end demo will have the vehicle be able to traverse a simple oval track with limited to no human intervention. This is mostly done for educational purposes and to satisfy some curiosity as to how these technologies work.
