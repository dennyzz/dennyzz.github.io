The photo albums are up in a rudimentary way. Mostly consistent with what this theme already has, with a very barebones setup for viewing photo albums. Despite the simplicity, there is the lightbox jquery script running so clicking on a photo will bring up the full res version and the lightbox. I think the thumbnails are probably too large still, so we'll think about outputting them in a smaller format. 
I'm still looking for another way to make the gallery more like a flickr/google images look and am looking into a few more plugins that would let it do the mosaic style, and probably fill the whole screen instead of just the small width which is the standard on this blog. Hopefully that difference won't be too much against any design rules or aesthestics. You can check out the galleries up top with the photos button in the navbar or click [Here](/gallery/)
